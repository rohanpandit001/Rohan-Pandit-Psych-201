# Rohan-Pandit-Psych-201
A hobby I have been pursuing recently has been journalism. I am an avid esports fan, and a game I have been in love with since 2015 is Rocket League. Since I have been in the scene for so long, I have developed long term connections with multiple players, and use my unique connections to get interviews with players and post about roster moves. I have had the opportunity to get paid for what I do, and I am going to be flown out to San Diego this April to cover the event.
